Create the gallow that the man would be hanged upon
First we would ask the user for a word that is going to be guessed
Create the variable that the word would be stored in
Clear the word off of the screen
Take the length of the word and create a number of underscores equal to it
If there are spaces in users input, keep them as spaces
Then we would ask another user for a letter guess
If the letter is in the word, put the letter in its original position
Repeat asking the user for a letter until the user runs out of guesses or the word is guessed
If they fail then after the hangman dies, display a game over screen and then offer an option to restart
If they succeed, then display a you won screen and then offer an option to restart
